                    The aim of this task is to see how well you can count your breathing. 
                    In this task you will be counting your breaths from 1-9. 
                    <strong>An <i>in and out</i> breath count as 1 breath.</strong> 
                    You can press/click the arrows on the right, or use your keyboard arrows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Press <strong style="color:green;">UP</strong> for each of the first 8 breaths in a sequence</li>
                        <li>Press <strong style="color:green;">DOWN</strong> for the 9th breath</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>After each breath, indicate if you are confident you are still on the correct count</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Press <strong style="color:green;">LEFT</strong> if you are unsure if you are on the correct count.</li>
                        <li>Press <strong style="color:green;">RIGHT</strong> if you are sure you are on the correct count.</li>
                        <li>e.g. <i>Breath 1: up, right. 2: up, right</i>... or <i>up</i> then <i>left</i> if you are not sure you have counted correctly.</li>
                        <li>You can change your confidence rating by entering in a new one before you press the next breath button.</li>
                        <li>Press <strong style="color:red;">SPACEBAR</strong> to reset and start counting from 1 if you are sure you've lost count.</li>
                    </ul>
                    You don't have to close your eyes or control your breathing, but only count in your head and not on your fingers.
                    There is a 2 minute practice with feedback, and the main task lasts 15 minutes. 
                    Please turn your sound on so you can hear the feedback on incorrect button presses.<br>
                    <p><i style="font-size:80%">When piloting this study, a high number of participants were spamming buttons in this task, or didn't read task instructions. 
                    Please remember this experiment is for inclusion in my PhD thesis and is the culmination of years of work. 
                    Not attempting to do the task properly will make analysis far more difficult. 
                    If you don't wish to genuinely take part in the experiment please close this page.</i></p>
