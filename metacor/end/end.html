        <p id="debrief">Thank you for taking part in this experiment!<br><br>
        This study is attempting to understand 'metacognition', which is 'thinking about thinking'
        - how well you are able to accurately assess your own state of mind, and the information you are consciously aware of.<br><br>
        In this study, we attempted to assess this by seeing how well you can assess your own performance on various tasks, by how well your confidence scores align with your task accuracy ('metacognitive efficiency').
        Specifically, we are interested in whether people who have high metacognitive efficiency on one task also have higher metacognitive efficiency on other tasks.
        By doing so, we aim to investigate if metacognitive abilities are a general resource which is shared across domains or faculties (like vision and memory), or if it is task or domain-specific.<br><br>
        If you have any further questions, feedback on the experiment, or would like to know how you did, please contact me at m.lovell [at] sussex.ac.uk.
